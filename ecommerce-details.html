              <p>
                  internet has revolutionized the shopping experience of many individuals. In the US alone, an staggering 230 million people buy their products online. While in the Philippines, only 2% of the population are online shoppers, it is expected that many people will quickly transition to e-commerce platforms. E-commerce platforms like Lazada and Shopee are at the forefront of this revolution in the country, which is expected to lead to increasing profits for their platforms. By 2018, Shopee had more than 8 million products from more than 300,000 sellers in their platform. And while these numbers are already huge, they are expected to continue growing. <br><br>
                  An important question that many of the sellers may have is: how can they differentiate their products in these platforms to make them more attractive for customers and increase sales with the overcrowded competition? <br><br>
                  In this project, I aim to give a step forward in solving this question with the use of Neural Networks. My objective is to help sellers to identify if their product will be successful or not, based on features of their product. This project serves as an overview of Deep Learning techniques and models that can be used for this task.<br><br>
                  For this project, I used a dataset extracted from Shopee website that contains 10,000 products from the Make-up category. The dataset was extracted with the use of Selenium, processed with BeautifulSoup, transformed to a pandas Dataframe format and cleaned using regular expressions.<br><br>
                  Then, 9 different Neural Networks models were implemented with the objective to find the best strategy to predict a product success. These models consist on Text classification, Image Classification, Multi-Layer Perceptrons and Multiple Input models. I defined success of a product by the total sales, which was calculated from the sales and price of each item. Another definition of successful products were items with sales more than PHP 50,000. he best performing models were text classification models based on the description of the item achieving an accuracy of 81%.

              <h2>Product Success in Ecommerce</h2>
              <p>
                 Ecommerce is transforming the way we do business, and with increasing competition it is important to define what are the aspects that make a product successful online. My model use a combination of state of the art algorithms like LSTM, BERT and pretrained model for computer vision like VGG19.
